# Prawn::Attachment

Attach files to Prawn PDF documents according to the PDF/A-3 standard.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'prawn-attachment'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install prawn-attachment

## Usage

Simply require the gem and attach your files the PDF document you're building with Prawn.

```ruby
require "prawn"
require "prawn/attachment"

Prawn::Document.generate("hello.pdf") do
  text "Hello World!"
  attach "data.json", File.open("./data.json")
end
```

If you open up the PDF in a view that supports PDF/A-3, like the standard [Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) you should be able to see the attached data in the "attachments" section.
